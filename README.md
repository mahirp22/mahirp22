## Hey there! <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaTU1Ympib3Vnb20xd3AxYzJ0bmsxcjdqYzI1Z2xjeGZjcW1haDIxZSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9cw/w1OBpBd7kJqHrJnJ13/giphy.gif" width="40" />

I’m Mahir, a software engineering student.

I like working on thoughtful projects and turning ideas into something real.

If something catches my interest, I’ll probably explore it, build it, and improve it over time.

My current focus is strengthening my fundamentals while building practical projects alongside my coursework.

I’ve got a few pinned projects here that reflect what I’m learning and experimenting with.

**Tools I use:**
- Languages: Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, PHP
- Web: HTML, CSS
- Databases: SQL, MySQL
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, XAMPP

**Fun facts:**
- I prefer progress over perfection
- I enjoy figuring things out as I go
- Most of my learning happens through building
